        <h3 class="description">Description</h3>
            <p>I ate this all the time growing up, and never knew it by name until I was today years old.
                It goes to show, presentation is nice, but what matters most is flavor, and this dish has plenty of it.
            </p>
            <p>It's also quite versatile! Feel free to serve this with basmati rice, fresh <a href="https://www.indianhealthyrecipes.com/paratha-recipe-plain-paratha/">
                parathas</a>, or even some of that frozen naan you can get at Trader Joes. The world is your Jalfrezi</a>.
