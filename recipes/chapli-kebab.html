<h1>Chapli Kebab</h1>

<h3>Description</h3>
    <p>I have a complicated history with chapli kebabs. On the one hand, they are absolutely scrumptious.
        On the other, don't send your easily embarrassed child to school with one of these and call it a hamburger.
        Everyone will smell the difference.
    </p>
    <p>This can of course be enjoyed by itself, as any meat patty can. Ideally, however, you have some sort of
        bread, and perhaps even some vegetables, to accompany it. Pickled red onions and raita can take this to
        the next level.
    </p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>cooking spray</li>
    <li>1 egg, lightly beaten</li>
    <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
    <li>1 tomatoes, finely chopped</li>
    <li>1 red onion, finely chopped</li>
    <li>1/4 cup finely chopped cilantro</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons ginger-garlic paste</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons coriander seeds, crushed</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>3/4 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
    <li>3/4 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper</li>
    <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil for frying, or more as needed</li>
    <li>2 tomatoes, sliced into rounds</li>
</ul>
<h3>Directions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Spray a small skillet with cooking spray; warm over medium-high heat. Pour egg into the skillet; cook and stir until scrambled and set, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Combine scrambled egg, beef, chopped tomato, onion, cilantro, mint, ginger-garlic paste, coriander seeds, salt, cumin, and cayenne pepper in a bowl. Mix by hand until well combined. Shape mixture into patties. Press a tomato slice into the center of each patty.</li>
    <li>Heat oil in a deep skillet to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Cook patties in the hot oil in batches until charred, 4 to 6 minutes per side.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Cook's Note</h3>
<p>Instead of crushed coriander seeds, you can also use 1 1/2 teaspoons coriander powder.</p>
